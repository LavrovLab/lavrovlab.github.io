<p>BCB546X, Biology Data Skills, will teach students the fundamental skills of data processing, management, and analysis that are essential for working with large data sets.  The course will include modules on basic UNIX commands, scripting in Python and R, version control using Git and GitHub, use of high performance computing clusters and writing effective data management plans.  The book “Bioinformatics Data Skills” by Vince Buffalo, part of the O’Reilly computational series, will be the primary text for the course.  This will be a 3-credit course meeting twice a week for 1.5 hours.  Topics will be taught in class using a combination of lectures and computational exercises.</p>

<p>This course is an introduction to more than 97% of the animal kingdom. It is organized around 15 major higher invertebrate taxa. For each we will first learn a ground plan and then consider selected topics pertinent to the taxon. You can expect to learn about diversity, evolution, phylogeny, classification, anatomy, development, physiology, behavior, ecology, natural history, and biomechanics.</p>
